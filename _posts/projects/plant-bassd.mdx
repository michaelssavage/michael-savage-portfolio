## about

In early 2020, Oisín Campbell, Michael Savage, and Peter Toal from Co. Monaghan, Ireland came together to form Plant Bass'd. Initially, the collective wanted to focus on sharing our love for music and throwing parties. However, it soon developed into something bigger, with a mission to showcase artists, releases, and club nights in the experimental dance music world.

The team shares a common goal and passion, and we aspire to create unforgettable Plant Bass'd events across Ireland and the UK. Our roles have evolved over time with Oisín primarily hosting parties in Edinburgh and Glasgow while I look after the website, Soundcloud, creating images. We all write articles and it has been immense in improving my writing skills.

## technologies used

The site is created using Next.js and Typescript React. It has come along way from it's early days and is now styled with Bootstrap 5 and SCSS, and the markdown posts are parsed by gray-matter, marked, and MDX. It is deployed using Vercel and I have gained some experience in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator creating cover images for articles.

It used to be a plain JavaScript and Markdown app but I am constantly learning new things I can apply.

## TLDR;

- Next.js app using Typescript React
- Styled using SCSS and Bootstrap 5
- Blog posts created using MDX
- Articles preview images created using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop
