## about

That's Savage specialise in high quality, custom print garments and logo design. With over 10 years experience in design and garment printing, there are no minimum order requirements meaning that we can print special one off garments while also catering for much larger orders.

## technologies used

This site was a plain JavaScript React app bundled with Create-React-App, but has been refactored over time to use Typescript and Vite. It use to use many different dependencies but these were reduced down over time to much more responsive and faster set up.

## TLDR;

- Typescript React App
- Styled using SCSS and Bootstrap 5
- ESLint helps to find problems
- Bundled using Vite
