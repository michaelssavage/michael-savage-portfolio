## Intellij Tips & Tricks

Some learnings while using Intellij may be obvious to others, but are still worth noting down in my opinion. One blaringly obvious example is that if you use a checkstyle on your code, you can include/ exclude the tests folder. The default behaviour in my case was that the tests folder was excluded, but it was checked in the pipeline on Gitlab causing a failure to happen. To change this, do the following:

1. Go to Code | Inspect Code.
2. Click 'Include test sources'
3. Click Analyse
