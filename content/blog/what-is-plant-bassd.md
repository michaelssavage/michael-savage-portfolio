# What is Plant Bass’d?

In early 2020, Oisín Campbell, Michael Savage, and Peter Toal from Co. Monaghan, Ireland came together to form Plant Bass'd. Initially, the collective's main focus was sharing our love for music and throwing parties. However, it soon developed into something bigger, with a mission to showcase artists, releases, and club nights in the experimental dance music world.

The team shares a common goal and passion, and we aspire to create unforgettable Plant Bass'd events across Ireland and the UK. Our roles have evolved over time with Oisín primarily hosting parties in Edinburgh and Glasgow while I look after the website, Soundcloud, and social media graphics. We write articles and it has been immense in improving my writing skills.
