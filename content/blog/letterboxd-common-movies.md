# Letterboxd Common Movies

I'm a big fan of using Letterboxd to track the movies I've watched and see what my friends have been watching. It's the best social media out there. You can view my page here :pretty-link{ link="https://letterboxd.com/ottobio/" text="on Letterboxd" external } .

I wanted to check what movies me and my friends both had in our watchlist so that we could narrow down the choices on movie night. I was never able to get access to the Letterboxd API so I forked a CLI project that returned common movies from Letterboxd users watchlists and I updated it to be Object Oriented. I extended the project to give the user a random movie from the users watchlists also which was a fun exercise.

Written in Python, it was a nice refresher for using the language since studying it in University.
