# Letterboxd Common Movies

I'm a big fan of using Letterboxd to track movies watched and see what my friends have been watching. It's the best social media out there. I wanted to check what movies me and my friends both had in our watchlist so that we could narrow down the choices on movie night.

I forked a CLI project that returns common movies from Letterboxd users watchlists. I updated it to be Object Oriented and also give the user a random movie from the users watchlists.

It's written in Python and it was a nice refresher for using the language.
