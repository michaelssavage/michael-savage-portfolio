# Spotify Developer API

On my About Page, you can see what I'm currently listening to and what my top tracks are on Spotify. It was a fun challenge to implement, helped by this blog :pretty-link{ link="https://navidanindya.info/writing/spotify-now-playing-nuxt/." external } Setting up the API, retrieving the desired data via Postman requests, and then calling the Spotify API using fetch requests took a bit of time. Here, I just go through briefly how I set it all up.

## Create an App on the Spotify Developer Dashboard

Visit the :pretty-link{ link="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/" text="Spotify Developer Dashboard" external } and log in with your Spotify credentials to create a new app.

This generates a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and which you'll want to save. Set the redirect URI to the local version of your site. It might be something like `http:localhost:3000` for you.

```tex
ðŸ’¡ If you deploy your site later, you will need to update the redirect URI to match the deployed site's URL.
```

## Get an Auth Code

To authorize your account, you need to create a URL that logs into Spotify and grants permission to the required scopes. Hereâ€™s what you need to construct the URL:

- Your saved `client_id`.
- The `redirect_uri`.
- The appropriate scopes for the information you want. I needed the current playing track and my top tracks, so I included all three scopes below.

```bash
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID_HERE>&
response_type=code&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URI_HERE>&
scope=user-read-currently-playing,user-read-playback-state,user-read-recently-played,user-top-read
```

After authorization, you will be redirected back to your site with a code query parameter in the URL. This code is needed to obtain the refresh token.

```bash
http://localhost:3000/callback?code=AQC7P..gBoDU
```

## Get Refresh Token

The `client_id:client_secret` combination needs to be encoded in Base64 format. You can use a function or a site like :pretty-link{ link="https://www.base64encode.org/." external }

:pic{ src="images/blog/base64.png" alt="base64 of client id and client secret" :isFloat="false" :inPost="true" sizes="1200px" }

I used Postman for sending the requests but here is the URL, Headers, and Body. You can also view the :pretty-link{ link="https://navidanindya.info/writing/spotify-now-playing-nuxt/" text="linked blog" external } for the `curl` request method.

```bash
POST: https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token

Headers: {
  Authorization: Basic <Base64_of_client_id:client_secret>,
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
}

Body: {
  grant_type: authorization_code,
  code: <Code_From_Redirect_Uri>,
  redirect_uri: http://localhost:3080
}
```

The important field here is the `refresh_token`. This token doesnâ€™t expire, so keep it safe.

## Get Access Token

Obtaining the access token follows the same process as getting the refresh token. Simply replace the code with the `refresh_token`.

```bash
POST: https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token

Headers: {
  Authorization: Basic <Base64_of_client_id:client_secret>,
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
}

Body: {
  grant_type: authorization_code,
  code: <Refresh_Token>
  redirect_uri: http://localhost:3080
}
```

The important field this time is the `access_token`. This token expires in one hour but can be used to retrieve your data. Below is the JSON response returned from Postman.

```json
{
  "access_token": "BQBYmAESfVG4lfO0xe.......",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "user-read-playback-state user-read-currently-playing user-read-recently-played user-top-read"
}
```

## Get Spotify Now Playing

To get the currently playing track, send a GET request using the `access_token` you received.

```bash
GET: https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing

Headers: {
  Authorization: Bearer <Access_Token>
}
```

If successful, a large JSON object will be returned with extensive information. The key details weâ€™re interested in are the track title (item name) and the artist (an array).

```json
{
  "item": {
    "artists": [
      {
        "id": "48vDIufGC8ujPuBiTxY8dm",
        "name": "Palace",
        "type": "artist"
      }
    ],
    "explicit": false,
    "name": "Make You Proud"
  },
  "is_playing": true
}
```

## Get Spotify Top Tracks

To get the top tracks you've listened to, send a GET request using the same `access_token` you received. There are two optional query parameters I've included. The long term `time_range` looks at listening history over the past year and the `limit` is set to return 5 items only.

```bash
GET: https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks?time_range=long_term&limit=5

Headers: {
  Authorization: Bearer <Access_Token>
}
```

All going well again, the following will be returned:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "album": {
        "artists": [
          {
            "name": "ANOTR"
          },
          {
            "name": "Abel Balder"
          }
        ],
        "name": "Relax My Eyes",
        "release_date": "2022-11-04"
      },
      "external_urls": {
        "spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/track/5u4hhtZ7f4rWkMZEZcTKrH"
      },
      "name": "Relax My Eyes",
      "popularity": 78
    }
  ]
}
```
