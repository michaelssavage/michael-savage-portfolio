# Data Application

Full stack application for creating data products using React, Typescript, React Query, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. This project, undertaken by me and two other team members, was a demo to replace an existing process that was undertaken through a complicated Excel sheet. We successfully allowed users to create data products through a smooth interface. As the user clicked through pages and gathered the requirements they specified, their results were stored using state management.

In the end, we implemented secure token-based authentication and I was given the chance to lead on the frontend architecture and design of the site. I used Photopea for wireframes, and learned to use Tanstack's React Query library. It was a hugely beneficial app for my development.
