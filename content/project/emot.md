My final year project was a customisable client based emotion classifier. The system uses data extraction, natural language processing, emotion classification, and machine learning to judge the sentiment of textual material being read online by a user.

The interface was built using PYQT5 and QT Designer. These Python tools are wrappers of the QT C++ libraries.
