## Technologies

The site is created using :pretty-link{link="https://nextjs.org/" text="Next.js" external } (a React framework) and Typescript. It has come along way from it's early days and is now styled with Bootstrap 5 and SCSS, and the markdown posts are parsed by gray-matter, marked, and MDX. It is deployed using Vercel and I have gained experience in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator creating cover images for articles. I've also learned how to use Adobe Premiere Pro to create graphics for projectors at some of the parties.

It used to be a plain JavaScript and Markdown app but I am constantly learning new things I can apply.
