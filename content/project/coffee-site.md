# Coffee Site

A coding interview challenge I completed using PostgreSQL, Nest.js backend, and a Next.js frontend. I used SCSS for styling and I learned how to use Nest.js and the new app router in Next.js for the first time.

## features

- On starting the backend, it will seed the coffee items for you.
- I created a form that appeared in a modal for creating new coffee items that saved to the backend.
- I added nice animations to the navbar as you scroll and animations for displaying the modal.
- I added a filter so that you could change between the different coffee types; Robusta and Arabic.
