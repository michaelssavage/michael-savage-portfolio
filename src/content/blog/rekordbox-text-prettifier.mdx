title: Rekordbox Text Prettifier

description: "Rekordbox is a DJ software for managing your music collection. You can record your mixes in it and then export the tracks that you played. I would upload my mixes to SoundCloud and paste the tracks into the description but the exported .txt file wouldn't be the most neatly formatted."

I needed a small script that would format the text in a nicer way for me. I opted for Python and created a really simple executable to get a setlist from a .txt file from Rekordbox. The exe was created using pyinstaller, and proved to be a small and nifty utility that I would come back to now and again.
