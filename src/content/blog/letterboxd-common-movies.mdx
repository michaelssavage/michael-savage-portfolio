description: "I wanted to find movie both my friends and I both had on our watchlists, so that we could narrow down the choices on movie night. I never got access to the elusive Letterboxd API, so I forked a CLI project that returned common movies from Letterboxd users watchlists and I updated it to be object-oriented."

I'm a big fan of using Letterboxd to track the movies I've watched and see what my friends have been watching. It's the best social media platform out there. You can check out my page on Letterboxd <Anchor link="https://letterboxd.com/ottobio/" text="here." variant="link" isExternal />

I wanted to find movie both my friends and I both had on our watchlists, so that we could narrow down the choices on movie night. I never got access to the elusive Letterboxd API, so I forked a CLI project that returned common movies from Letterboxd users watchlists and I updated it to be object-oriented.

I extended the project to give the user a random movie from our watchlists, which was a fun exercise. This small project is written in Python and was a great way to refresh my skills in the language since studying it at university.
