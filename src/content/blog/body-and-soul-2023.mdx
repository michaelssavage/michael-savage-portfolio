description: "I danced, I laughed, I ate, I drank, and I had some good times. My feet danced to Shanti Celeste, HAAi, Joy Anonymous, and Gerd Janson. My emotions swirled from listening to Ye Vagabonds, Anna Mieke, The Blaze, and Kurt Vile & The Violators. My belly tensed with laughter from I'm Grand Mam, David O'Doherty, and Michael Fry & Killian Sundermann."
