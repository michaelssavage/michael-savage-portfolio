A full-stack TypeScript application that automatically curates a Spotify playlist based on new releases from user-saved artists. Built with React and Express using a monorepo architecture and Clean Code principles.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

<hr />

**React + Vite**: Modern frontend built with TypeScript and Vite for the best development experience

**Authentication**: Secure Spotify OAuth integration with protected routes using Tanstack Router

**State Management**: React Query for server state management, caching, and automatic data synchronization

**Build**: Production build served as static assets through Express

### Backend

<hr />

**Express.js Server**: TypeScript-based REST API implementing a Clean Architecture pattern

**Layer Separation**:
- *Router*: Route definitions and request handling
- *Controller*: Request validation and response formatting
- *Service*: Core business logic and Spotify API integration
- *Repository*: MongoDB data access and persistence

**Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components for better testability and maintainability

**Automated Updates**: Daily cron job scanning and processing new releases from tracked artists

**Database**: MongoDB for artist data persistence

## Infrastructure

<hr />

**Monorepo Structure**: Unified development workflow with shared configurations and types

**Single Origin**: Consolidated deployment with the Express server handling both API requests and static asset serving

**Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript implementation with shared type definitions

**Initialization**: Centralized application bootstrap through index.ts with dependency injection container setup
