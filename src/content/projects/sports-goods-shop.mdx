# Max's Sports Goods Shop

CRUD app focused on the frontend which is used for managing social ads on Facebook. Starting from a JSON array of products, I can create many new ads based off of these products. The focus wasn't on backend work or database but I still wanted data to persist so I opted for Firestore. It is a NoSQL db that can be queried pretty simply.

Each ad consists of 1 or more pictures, a description, a headline, and a CTA (call to action). The ad is supposed to look like: <BlogLink link="https://admockups.com/facebook-ad-mockup" external />

- New ads can be created for a product.
- Ads for a specific product can be viewed, edited, and deleted.
- Navigation with react-router-dom.
